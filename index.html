          <p >I am a rational person, who likes to optimize her activities and life. I also like to learn new things and to feel how my brain works. I wanted to belong to a group of smart, interesting people who create the future. So I decided to become a programmer. 
          </p>
          <p>In the beginning it was very difficult, but I didn't give up. My enthusiasm and endurance keep to grow, because when you cannot complete a task, try to do it again and again, and when you come to an answer, you experience incredible delight! Serotonin strike in your brain and you become addicted to it.
          </p>
          <p>And, in the end, when I started to study programming, I realized that in this area I can reveal my personality, apply and improve my inclinations and, in general, be myself and feel happy.

        <p>I was lucky to have internship in [LEXX Trading Platform](https://lexxtg.com). At that time I first tried to work with Git, namely [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/navarichanastasia), because this team uses it. Also I saw the structure of a large project on **Vue.js**, how the work was organized on it and this formed my idea of ​​what elese I need to learn.</p>
